- Write a function that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

- Run a loop that will find the current index number and the next index number and compare both numbers.
- If the returned value is both odd insert a dash in between and push it the storage array.
