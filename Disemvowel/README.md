## CodeWar Challenge 07
- Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
- Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

We atempt to use forloop to loop through every character and find the vowels and then replace with an empty string.
Found out an easier and cleaner way to solve this challenge with Regular Expression.
